# CHANGELOG

## 2026-02-28

### UX + Accessibility polish
- Added keyboard-accessible skip links on EN/IS pages for faster navigation to game tabs.
- Added `aria-live` to active game chip so tab changes are announced more clearly.
- Improved mobile tab readability (less truncation, better wrapping, single-column layout on very small screens).
- Added stronger focus styles for language switch button.
- Added arrow/Home/End keyboard navigation for game tabs and roving `tabindex` support.

### Content and language consistency
- Standardized tab heading quality/format so all game tabs use consistent progression scope labels.
- Rebuilt `script-is.js` from clean, parity-safe content baseline to remove mixed-language/encoding rough phrasing.
- Kept Icelandic page interaction labels localized (selector + phase headings).

### Notes
- No changes were made under `/abg`.
