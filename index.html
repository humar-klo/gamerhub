        <h3>No Man's Sky — 30 precision tips (beginner → advanced)</h3>
        <div class="faq-list">
          <details><summary>1) Is No Man's Sky worth starting in 2026?</summary><p>Yes. It’s one of those games where depth is now the selling point: exploration, base building, economy loops, expeditions, and co-op all feel mature.</p></details>
          <details><summary>2) Can I play fully solo?</summary><p>Yes. You can disable multiplayer entirely and still complete story arcs, progression, and endgame loops.</p></details>
          <details><summary>3) Is crossplay supported?</summary><p>Yes across major platforms. Most failures come from version mismatch, network restrictions, or outdated friend/session data—check patch parity first.</p></details>
          <details><summary>4) What's a reliable way to earn Units early?</summary><p>Best low-friction combo: Scanner upgrades (big scan payouts), station mission board jobs you can stack naturally, and selling salvage while you explore. This scales without needing advanced farms.</p></details>
          <details><summary>5) How do I get Nanites quickly?</summary><p>Fastest practical loop is usually outlaw stations: buy Suspicious Packet (Tech/Arms), open them, then sell the resulting modules to technology merchants for nanites. Top this up with discovery uploads and mission rewards.</p></details>
          <details><summary>6) Best early-game multitool upgrades?</summary><p>Scanner module first (income), then Mining Beam efficiency/overheat control, then one reliable combat line (Boltcaster or Pulse Spitter) with supporting upgrades.</p></details>
          <details><summary>7) How do I get a better ship?</summary><p>Current meta route is Sentinel Interceptor hunting on dissonant planets. Secondary routes: station shopping for class rolls and restoring crashed ships for profit/collection.</p></details>
          <details><summary>8) Is base building required?</summary><p>Not mandatory, but functionally important. A simple utility base with teleporter, refiners, storage, and power saves huge time.</p></details>
          <details><summary>9) What should I store in cargo vs regular inventory?</summary><p>Bulk mats in Cargo, high-frequency crafting items in regular inventory. Treat regular slots as your active workbench.</p></details>
          <details><summary>10) How do I unlock the Space Anomaly?</summary><p>Progress the early Awakenings/Artemis flow and complete initial warp milestones. After that, you can summon the Anomaly as your core hub for upgrades, missions, and multiplayer.</p></details>
          <details><summary>11) What are stable mid-game money methods?</summary><p>Interceptor salvage loops, frigate expeditions, and dedicated crafting/refining chains are the most dependable. Pick one primary loop and optimize it instead of juggling five half-built methods.</p></details>
          <details><summary>12) Can I move my base to another planet?</summary><p>Not in one button. Standard method is build a new base, migrate key infrastructure, then keep teleporter links so old locations still have utility.</p></details>
          <details><summary>13) Do planets change over time?</summary><p>Mostly persistent, but major universe-generation updates can alter some planetary visuals/terrain behavior.</p></details>
          <details><summary>14) What's the point of freighters?</summary><p>Freighters are your mobile command center: (1) huge centralized storage, (2) frigate expedition income, (3) portable build space, (4) system-to-system logistics anchor, and (5) late-game quality-of-life backbone. If you like long sessions, a well-built freighter saves the most time per hour of play.</p></details>
          <details><summary>15) How do I recruit frigates?</summary><p>Scan recruitable frigates in NPC fleets before buying. Build role coverage first (combat/trade/exploration/industrial), then optimize traits and fuel efficiency—don’t overpay early.</p></details>
          <details><summary>16) How do I reduce inventory clutter?</summary><p>Set strict keep/sell rules, offload to storage containers frequently, and convert low-value stacks into refined outputs or cash.</p></details>
          <details><summary>17) Is survival mode much harder than normal?</summary><p>Yes. Hazard pressure and resource friction are significantly higher, so route planning and inventory discipline matter more.</p></details>
          <details><summary>18) What's the difference between Atlas Path and Artemis Path?</summary><p>Different narrative focus. Artemis is your core story spine; Atlas is more philosophical/cosmic and complements long-form progression.</p></details>
          <details><summary>19) Can I own multiple ships?</summary><p>Yes. Most players keep specialized ships (daily driver, cargo, fighter/interceptor, etc.) rather than one do-it-all.</p></details>
          <details><summary>20) How do I find specific planet types?</summary><p>Use both methods: system-hopping for discovery and community glyph/coordinate databases when you need exact targets fast. For rare hunts, coordinates are dramatically more time-efficient.</p></details>
          <details><summary>21) What's the best long-term way to farm resources?</summary><p>Automated extraction bases + refiner pipelines. Passive production beats manual gathering once your infrastructure is online.</p></details>
          <details><summary>22) Are settlements worth managing?</summary><p>Worth it as side content and flavor, not as your primary progression engine.</p></details>
          <details><summary>23) How does companion/pet taming work?</summary><p>Adopt compatible fauna by feeding, then use egg sequencing to tune behavior/traits over generations.</p></details>
          <details><summary>24) Can I rearrange technology layout later?</summary><p>Yes. Packaging/reinstalling tech to optimize adjacency is a standard mid/late-game optimization step.</p></details>
          <details><summary>25) Best way to travel huge distances?</summary><p>Hyperdrive upgrades for general movement; portals/teleporters for exact routing. Use each for what it does best.</p></details>
          <details><summary>26) Why am I getting attacked so often by sentinels?</summary><p>You’re likely on high-security worlds or triggering protected actions. Break line-of-sight fast and disengage before escalation.</p></details>
          <details><summary>27) Is permadeath worth trying?</summary><p>Yes if you enjoy high consequence planning. It turns routine choices into meaningful risk management.</p></details>
          <details><summary>28) How do expeditions work?</summary><p>They’re time-limited milestone campaigns with unique rewards tied to that expedition track. If you miss one, watch official redux/holiday rerun windows.</p></details>
          <details><summary>29) What's best to focus on in week one?</summary><p>Exosuit slot expansion, reliable income loop, Anomaly unlock, and one compact utility base.</p></details>
          <details><summary>30) Endgame: what do most players do?</summary><p>Ship/freighter min-maxing, ambitious base projects, expedition reward chasing, and relaxed exploration/community sharing.</p></details>

      <div class="tab-panel" id="panel-nioh" role="tabpanel" hidden>
        <h3>Nioh 3 — 30 precision combat/progression tips (beginner → advanced)</h3>
        <div class="faq-list">
          <details><summary>1) Is Nioh 3 beginner friendly?</summary><p>It is challenging, but very learnable if you focus on fundamentals first: guarding, Ki management, and safe punishes.</p></details>
          <details><summary>2) What's the biggest mistake new players make?</summary><p>Overattacking until Ki is empty. Running out of Ki in front of enemies is one of the fastest ways to die.</p></details>
          <details><summary>3) Do stances matter much?</summary><p>Yes. Stance choice directly affects damage, speed, defense, and Ki usage.</p></details>
          <details><summary>4) Is Ki Pulse still core?</summary><p>Yes, mastering Ki recovery timing remains a core combat skill for sustained pressure and survival.</p></details>
          <details><summary>5) Should I main one weapon at first?</summary><p>Usually yes. One primary weapon plus a backup makes early mastery faster.</p></details>
          <details><summary>6) Best early approach to stats?</summary><p>Meet minimum requirements first, then prioritize survivability and Ki comfort before heavy damage scaling. Early balance beats glass-cannon experimentation.</p></details>
          <details><summary>7) Light or heavy armor for beginners?</summary><p>Use what keeps you in a comfortable agility bracket. Mobility and Ki control are usually safer than overloading.</p></details>
          <details><summary>8) How do I survive boss fights better?</summary><p>Identify 2–3 guaranteed punish windows, keep Ki reserve for defensive resets, and avoid panic inputs. Consistency beats burst greed in almost every difficult fight.</p></details>
          <details><summary>9) Is blocking viable or should I always dodge?</summary><p>Both matter. Good defense is a mix of guard discipline, dodge timing, and positioning.</p></details>
          <details><summary>10) Are Onmyo/Ninjutsu worth investing in?</summary><p>Yes. Even light investment in utility (buff uptime, debuffs, control tools) gives huge survivability/value compared with pure raw damage stacking.</p></details>
          <details><summary>11) Should I optimize gear heavily early?</summary><p>Not heavily. Replace gear naturally while leveling, then optimize once build direction is clear.</p></details>
          <details><summary>12) Do set bonuses matter?</summary><p>Yes, especially later. Early on they're helpful; endgame synergy makes them much more important.</p></details>
          <details><summary>13) Soul match now or later?</summary><p>Mostly later. Early soul matching can burn resources for short-lived gains.</p></details>
          <details><summary>14) Is co-op useful for progression?</summary><p>Yes. It can reduce friction while you learn mechanics, though fundamentals still matter.</p></details>
          <details><summary>15) Is parrying mandatory?</summary><p>No. Strong play without heavy parry reliance is completely viable.</p></details>
          <details><summary>16) Why do enemies feel so punishing?</summary><p>The combat system rewards precision and punishes poor Ki and spacing decisions.</p></details>
          <details><summary>17) How do I handle yokai pressure?</summary><p>Focus on Ki damage, create space, and punish only when openings are clear.</p></details>
          <details><summary>18) Is overleveling enough to carry story?</summary><p>It helps, but mechanics and clean execution remain the main skill checks.</p></details>
          <details><summary>19) Fastest way to improve?</summary><p>Deliberate drills: one session = one mechanic (Ki Pulse timing, stance transitions, spacing discipline). Skill jumps come faster than random full-kit grinding.</p></details>
          <details><summary>20) What should I unlock first in skill trees?</summary><p>Core passives, Ki efficiency tools, and reliable bread-and-butter options before niche tech.</p></details>
          <details><summary>21) Is ranged combat useful?</summary><p>Yes. Use it for controlled pulls, safe opener damage, and pressure resets in multi-enemy scenarios.</p></details>
          <details><summary>22) Sell or dismantle loot?</summary><p>Dismantle is often better for crafting progression unless you urgently need currency.</p></details>
          <details><summary>23) How important is agility rating?</summary><p>Very important. It strongly affects movement feel, Ki usage, and consistency.</p></details>
          <details><summary>24) Is there one best build for everyone?</summary><p>No. Strong builds are usually the ones that fit your timing and preferred weapon flow.</p></details>
          <details><summary>25) Are status effects worth building around?</summary><p>Yes, status pressure can create strong windows and improve overall damage uptime.</p></details>
          <details><summary>26) When should I start true min-maxing?</summary><p>After campaign stability, when you're farming high-tier gear and refining a final build path.</p></details>
          <details><summary>27) How do I recover from repeated deaths?</summary><p>Lower complexity: simplify build choices, reduce risk, and re-focus on fundamentals.</p></details>
          <details><summary>28) Should I swap builds constantly?</summary><p>Usually no. Frequent swapping slows learning; stick with one direction long enough to master it.</p></details>
          <details><summary>29) Quick pre-boss checklist?</summary><p>Check weight/agility, healing stock, shortcuts, buffs, and a clear opening plan.</p></details>
          <details><summary>30) What does endgame usually become?</summary><p>Build refinement, challenge content, gear optimization, and mechanical mastery.</p></details>
